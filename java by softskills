Java is a object  oriented language.
There r 2 data-types :Integer type(Byte,Short,Integer,Long) Floating type(Float,Double)
along with this Character datatype(16 bits -eg: 'a' , '\u001y')  and  Boolean(1 bit   -eg: TRUE,FALSE)
Variables are 3 types :-
local variables : a variable defined within a block or method or constructer.
static variables : decleard using a static keyword within a class outside any method constructer or block 
instance variables : These are non-static variables and are decleard in a class outside any method constructer or block.

why dynamic arrays in Java are slower than standard arrays in java ?
Normal arrays that are used in Java are of fixed length. Once an array is created in Java its size cannot be increased 
or decreased. Array lists are dynamic and can be created with an initial size and later the size can be increased if more 
data is added and also it can be decreased if any data is removed.
